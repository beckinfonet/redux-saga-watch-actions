# Middleware : sagaMiddleware

Used for adding redux-saga as middleware. This is *exactly* the same as the `sagaMiddleware` returned from  [`createSagaMiddleware()`](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga/docs/api/index.html#createsagamiddlewareoptions).

### `sagaMiddleware`

```js
import sagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga-watch-actions/lib/middleware'
```
